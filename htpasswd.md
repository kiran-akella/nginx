# 🔐 htpasswd: Usage & Benefits

## 📌 What is htpasswd?
`htpasswd` is a command-line tool used to create and manage username-password authentication for web servers like Apache. It helps secure directories by requiring users to enter valid credentials before accessing restricted content.

## ⚙️ How to Use htpasswd

### 1️⃣ Install htpasswd
If `htpasswd` is not installed, you can get it via:

**For Ubuntu/Debian**
```sh
sudo apt install apache2-utils
```
**For CentOS/RHEL**
```sh
sudo yum install httpd-tools
```

### 2️⃣ Create a New User
To create a new `.htpasswd` file and add a user:
```sh
htpasswd -c /path/to/.htpasswd username
```
(You'll be prompted to enter a password.)

### 3️⃣ Add or Update Users
To add another user or update an existing one:
```sh
htpasswd /path/to/.htpasswd another_user
```

### 4️⃣ Remove a User
```sh
htpasswd -D /path/to/.htpasswd username
```

### 5️⃣ Configure `.htaccess`
To enable authentication, add this to your `.htaccess` file:
```
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Restricted Access"
AuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd
Require valid-user
```
